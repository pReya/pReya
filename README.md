### 🙋🏻 Welcome fellow stranger!

My name is Moritz and I'm a Software developer based in ⚓️ Hamburg, Germany. I used to be a tech journalist before I became a developer. Though I have a degree in "Technical Computer Science" (which is similar to Computer Engineering) 🛠 I have been working on the opposite end of the industry in recent years, creating mostly web based applications🕸.
