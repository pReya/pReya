### 🙋🏻 Welcome fellow stranger!

My name is Moritz and I'm a JavaScript developer based in Hamburg, Germany. I used to be a tech journalist before I became a developer. Now I mostly write frontend-code for React applications at my workplace [@ubilabs](https://github.com/ubilabs). Feel free to follow me on Twitter:
