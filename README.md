### 🙋🏻 Welcome fellow stranger!

My name is Moritz and I'm a Software developer based in ⚓️ Hamburg, Germany. I used to be a tech journalist before I became a developer. Though I have a degree in "Technical Computer Science" (which is similar to Computer Engineering, so deals with a lot of hardware and low-level languages) 🛠 I have been working on the opposite end of the industry in recent years, creating very high-level, web-based applications 🕸.
